# Installation

Either:
* Use a plugin manager like vundle
* Clone the plugin into your plugins directory
  * If you use the ~/.vim folder to your vim files, this will be ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/
* Move the *.vim files into your /colors directory (default is ~/.vim/colors)

```sh
# with https
git clone https://github.com/patricksharp/phosphor.vim ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/phosphor.vim

# with ssh
git clone git@github.com/patricksharp/phosphor.vim ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/phosphor.vim
```
